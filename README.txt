All files should run under IDE, ex. I am using Eclipse

Instructions: run the Main.java file for part 1 test
	      run CatTest.java for unit test


Explain:   Files all stored in Granify folder.
	  Cat class is for creating objects cat, there will be a random age(between 5-10) assign to the object cat.
	  You can assign name, age, favourite food for the cat.
	  When a cat speak 5 times, its age will be increased by 1.
	  
	  Dog class is a subclass of Cat class, with some "dog-like" changes.
	  Data class is responsible for storing cat objects
	 
Importance: I use method overloading for optional name for new cat
	    and for the speak() methods weather there is a optional argument or not

For the homework.sql
	there is a query for creating table 
	and two examples for inserting new cats
